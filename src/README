# DateFBD
Divergence time distribution from fossil ages and topologies

Software includes
 - 'dist'
	computes the divergence time distibution associated to a given clade from a set of possible trees, the fossil stratigraphic intervals and provides coda files for MCMC convergence diagnostics
 - 'diag'
	same input as 'dist', provides coda files for MCMC convergence diagnostics
 - 'tree'
	computes the divergence time distribution associated to a given set of nodes of a single tree, the fossil stratigraphic intervals
 - 'esti'
	estimates the speciation, extinction and fossilization rates from a set of possible trees, the fossil stratigraphic intervals
 - 'draw'
	draws a single tree with the fossil stratigraphic intervals
 - R package 'rfbd'
	implements 'dist' and 'diag' in the R environment (some features of the standalone software such as the multithreading are not available yet)

Directory "src" contains the C sources of the standalone software

Archive file "rfbd_0.0.tar.gz" contains the R package 'rfdb', including source files and manual

Directory "data" contains the dataset studied in "Exact distribution of divergence times from fossil ages and topologies":
	'CotylosauriaTree.phy' contains 100 equiparsimonious trees of Cotylosauria
	'CotylosauriaAges.csv' contains the fossil ages
	'Optimisation_Parameters' are the parameters of the numerical optimisation used for determining the speciation, extinction and fossilization rates


A complete description of the options of the programs is given below.
